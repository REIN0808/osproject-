quick review:

FUSE Operations: The code correctly defines functions for common file operations such as getattr, readdir, mkdir, mknod, rename, and others. These are typical operations for a file system, so this looks right in terms of structure.

File System Data: The in-memory storage is managed via arrays paths[], types[], sizes[], and blocks[]. This matches a simple in-memory file system approach where file metadata and contents are stored.

Initialization: The use of struct fuse_operations at the end ties in with how FUSE works, assigning function pointers to the actual operations.

Potential Issues: There are a few potential concerns:

FUSE typically expects full paths for all files, but this code appears to handle only single-level paths.
The handling of errors (like file not found, invalid file types, etc.) is minimal. Real FUSE file systems tend to return appropriate error codes like -ENOENT or -EEXIST.
The logic for allocating and managing file blocks could become problematic if this were extended to larger datasets.
